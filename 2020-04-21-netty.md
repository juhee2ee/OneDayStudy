FixedLengthFrameDecoder
--------------------------------
```html
public class FixedLengthFrameDecoder
extends FrameDecoder
A decoder that splits the received ChannelBuffers by the fixed number of bytes. For example, if you received the following four fragmented packets:
 +---+----+------+----+
 | A | BC | DEFG | HI |
 +---+----+------+----+
 
A FixedLengthFrameDecoder(3) will decode them into the following three packets with the fixed length:
 +-----+-----+-----+
 | ABC | DEF | GHI |
 +-----+-----+-----+
```
